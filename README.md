An API that calls itself, hashes txt files as well.

# 1) Set Up:

```
npm install
node server.js
```

# Testing

using POSTMAN, navigate to body ==> form data here is what the endpoint 3 request looks like, you can use the same files or different files the API will tell you if they have the same hashes:

Here is an example of curl for endpoint 2 if you prefer curl:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "file=@/path/to/your/file" http://localhost:3000/api/data2

```

To test endpoint1, you can go to /utils and replace the randomFile.txt by any file you want just make sure to rename it to randomFile.txt, and it's a GET request.

# Note:

You can also use html files if you like the hashing function takes cares of normalizing html files as well.
