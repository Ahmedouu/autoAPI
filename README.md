# A demo


An API that calls itself, hashes some files you give to it as well.

# 1) Set Up:

```
npm install
node server.js
```

# Testing

using POSTMAN or whatever tool you prefer, navigate to body ==> form data here is what the endpoint3 test looks like, endpoint2 is the same but it takes only one file and the key is just file:

So in endpoint1, you can go /utils and replace the randomFile.txt by any file you want just make sure to rename to randomFile. 


# Note:

You can also use html files if you like the hashing function takes cares of normalizing html files as well.
