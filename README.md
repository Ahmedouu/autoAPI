# APIFun
# A demo


So while working on a previous project, I had an idea to implement something like this to solve a certain problem, my idea was pushed to the side so in any case I will demo what I wanted to do, I will try to make it as general as possible.


# 1) Set Up:
run npm install first of all, then run node server.js


# Testing
I am back to working from my windows machine, so I will show you how to use powershell to handle api requests, of course you can download curl or postman or anything else but I prefer to powershell whenever possible
